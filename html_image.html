They are independent, playful, and loving creatures, often forming strong bonds with their owners. Unlike dogs, cats are more low-maintenance, but they still require attention and care. Many cats enjoy curling up in cozy spots and napping for hours, but they are also known for their bursts of energy, often chasing toys or simply running around the house. Cats communicate with their owners through purring, meowing, and body language, and each cat has its own unique personality. With proper care and a little patience, cats make wonderful companions and can bring joy and comfort to any home.</p>
